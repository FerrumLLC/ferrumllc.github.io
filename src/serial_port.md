# Using a Serial Port

In this book, examples are given in terms of serial console input and output. Each line in the example implicitly has a
[Line Terminator](serial_port/line_terminator.md) proceeding it, except for the Input Prompt (">>> ") line, as defined
in [Command Echoing](serial_port/command_echoing.md).

TODO: This section should explain how to connect to a serial port, write to it, and read from it.
