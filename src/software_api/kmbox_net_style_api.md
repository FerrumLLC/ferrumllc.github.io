# KMBox Net Style API

**For future projects, use of the KMBox Net API is STRONGLY discouraged**. This API is not very well made, and overall
not fun to work with. I suggest using the [DHZBox Style API](./dhzbox_style_api.md), or the standard
[Keyboard and Mouse API](./km_api.md) instead, as they are much more clear, easier to work with, and easier to add
features to.

Ferrum's Software API supports KMBox Net Style commands via the UDP Socket. Simply connect via the details listed in the
`Net API` tab in the Ferrum App, and send KMBox Net commands as defined in their documentation:
<https://github.com/kvmaibox/kmboxnet>. Note that not all commands are supported, but most of the essential ones
are.
