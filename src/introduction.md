# Introduction

This is the documentation for Ferrum's developer APIs, as well as some internal functionality. It contains information
and recommendations around using Ferrum as a developer. It can also apply as documentation for other similar products
with compatible APIs.

Ferrum consists of two APIs: the [Legacy API](legacy_api.md), and the [Software API](software_api.md). The Software API
is powered by the Ferrum App/Software on the user's input pc. Currently, Linux users are limited to only using
the Legacy API, as the Software API is only compatible with Microsoft Windows.
