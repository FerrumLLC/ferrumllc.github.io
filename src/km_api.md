# Keyboard and Mouse API

The Keyboard and MouseAPI, aka KM API, is a simple set of commands used to control much of Ferrum's functionality. It allows software to press and release mouse buttons or keyboard keys. Software can also use it to block keys from being sent to the output computer, or to read the state of a physical button or key on a peripheral.

The following sections provide information and pseudocode examples for the different commands available.
